# 🏡 Home Value Prediction System

The Home Value Prediction System is a machine learning project that estimates residential property prices based on various housing features such as area, number of rooms, location factors, and other related attributes. The objective of this project is to build a reliable regression model that can assist in predicting house values using historical data.

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline — from raw data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and real-time prediction.
